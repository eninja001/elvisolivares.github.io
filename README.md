                <li><strong>What 3 adjectives would you use to describe yourself? Why?-</strong> Sleepy, distant and not lazy during gym. I'm semi-lazy under normal circcumstances, but in gym I very, much enjoy doing activities in P.E. Im usually sleepy because my body has a really wonky sleep schedule that i cannot change no matter what. Distant because I think to myself and prefer to usually work alone unless I can't.   
                <li><strong> What is/are your favorite subject(s) in school? Why?-</strong> I enjoy Gym, Reading, and Science the most. Gym i enjoy because even though I am short, im still more athletic than most people of a better build. I love reading because its abstract and it's not based on a set answer. Most peices of writing are subjective. I like
